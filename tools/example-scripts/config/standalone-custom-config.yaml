# This ConfigMap gets passed to all core cluster members to configure them.
# Take note that some networking settings like internal hostname still get configured
# when the pod starts, but most non-networking specific configs can be tailored here.
#
# When your pods start, you will inherit the config in common-configmap.yaml, so you don't
# need to repeat any of that here, just focus on overrides that are different than what's there.
# This includes a per pod setting of the advertised address
